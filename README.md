## Summary

I am a 4th year student at Ege University Computer Engineering. I worked as a coordinator and member in various student clubs. I attach importance to team projects and the ideas of my teammates. I am not addicted to technology. I can easily adapt to new platforms. It is important to participate in many technical camps and courses. I used Java, C, C #, Python, Postgresql in projects.  I'm curious. I like to question and research. I work on Java,Spring and  Algorithms, I plan a career in these fields.
